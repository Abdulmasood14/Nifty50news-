{"company_name": "BAJAJ-AUTO LTD", "extracted_text": "On August 22, 2025, Bajaj Auto Ltd announced the resumption of deliveries for its Chetak electric scooter across all dealerships after resolving a global shortage of rare earth magnets, which are critical components for the scooter.\n\nThis is considered a significant corporate development as Bajaj Auto had previously faced production challenges related to this shortage, even considering the possibility of a \"zero production month\" for the Chetak in August. Overcoming these supply chain issues and restarting deliveries signifies a positive step forward for the company, particularly in a segment \u2013 electric two-wheelwheelers \u2013 where it experienced a temporary dip in market share in August. The resumption of production ensures availability of the Chetak for the upcoming festive season, which is crucial for sales in the automotive industry.", "links_raw": "1. https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rare-earth-magnets-crunch-eases-bajaj-auto-resumes-supplies-of-e-scooter-chetak-rajiv-bajaj-had-earlier-warned-of-zero-production-month/articleshow/123450664.cms#:~:text=Rajiv%20Gauba-,Rare%20earth%20magnets%20crunch%20eases:%20Bajaj%20Auto%20resumes%20supplies%20of,could%20result%20in%20zero%20production.\n2. https://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/bajaj-auto-restarts-chetak-deliveries-secures-supplies-rare-earth-magnets-125082201272_1.html#:~:text=Home%20/%20Companies%20/%20News%20/%20Bajaj,50%20per%20cent%20in%20July.\n3. https://www.ndtv.com/topic/bajaj-auto#:~:text=News%20Result(s)-,KTM%20160%20Duke%20Review:%20Do%20Expectations%20Meet%20Performance?,Auto%20%7C%20Written%20by%20Kingshuk%20Dutta\n4. https://www.angelone.in/news/market-updates/ev-2-wheeler-sales-august-2025-ather-takes-second-spot-as-bajaj-drops#:~:text=as%20Bajaj%20Drops-,EV%202%2DWheeler%20Sales%20August%202025:%20Ather%20Takes%20Second%20Spot,5%20with%20Vida%20VX2%20Launch", "processed_links": ["https://1. https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rare-earth-magnets-crunch-eases-bajaj-auto-resumes-supplies-of-e-scooter-chetak-rajiv-bajaj-had-earlier-warned-of-zero-production-month/articleshow/123450664.cms#:~:text=Rajiv%20Gauba-", "https://could%20result%20in%20zero%20production.\n2. https://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/bajaj-auto-restarts-chetak-deliveries-secures-supplies-rare-earth-magnets-125082201272_1.html#:~:text=Home%20/%20Companies%20/%20News%20/%20Bajaj", "https://50%20per%20cent%20in%20July.\n3. https://www.ndtv.com/topic/bajaj-auto#:~:text=News%20Result(s)-", "https://Auto%20%7C%20Written%20by%20Kingshuk%20Dutta\n4. https://www.angelone.in/news/market-updates/ev-2-wheeler-sales-august-2025-ather-takes-second-spot-as-bajaj-drops#:~:text=as%20Bajaj%20Drops-"], "date": "2025-08-22"}
